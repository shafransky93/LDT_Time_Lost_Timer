# LDT Time Lost Timer
This program is a Python GUI application created using the tkinter library. It's designed to assist LDT operators in tracking and logging time lost during their observation sessions with the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT).

Key features include:

* Timer Function: Users can start and stop a timer to measure elapsed observation time. The timer display updates in real-time.

* Logging: The application allows users to log start and stop times, along with total observing time lost, by clicking the "Log" button.

* Log Display: A scrollable text area presents logged entries, including time details and cumulative observation time lost.

* Menu Bar: The GUI features a menu for program exit and access to an "About" dialog explaining its use.

* Visual Indicators: "Start" and "Stop" buttons change color to indicate the timer's state visually.

* Help Dialog: An "About" dialog provides concise instructions for using the program effectively.

This tool streamlines timekeeping for operators, enabling efficient logging of observation loss time while using the Lowell Discovery Telescope.
