* Logging: The application allows users to log start and stop times, along with total observing time lost, by clicking the "Log" button.

* Log Display: A scrollable text area presents logged entries, including time details and cumulative observation time lost.

* Reason Tab: Dropdown menu to select reson for closure.

* Menu Bar: The GUI features a menu for program exit and access to an "About" dialog explaining its use.

* Help Dialog: An "About" dialog provides concise instructions for using the program effectively.

This tool streamlines timekeeping for operators, enabling efficient logging of observation loss time while using the Lowell Discovery Telescope.
